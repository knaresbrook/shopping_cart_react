Shopping Cart Demo using React v16.3.0

This is a simple Shopping Cart Demo developed using React v16.3.0, this project demonstrates using react-redux.
The following packages are used: react, react-router-dom, redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, redux-logger, redux-persist, axios and bootstrap.

This project would be useful for people struggling with react-redux. In this project I am showing how to persist state data even on browser refresh using redux-persist.
